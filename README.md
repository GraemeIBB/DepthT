# Depth Training Suite
The aim of this project is to provide a suite for producing testing, tuning, and inferencing a model with two input images; One RGB image, and one depth image.

The finished product will allow a user to input a yolo style dataset with depth data, and train a model utilizing methods outlined [here.](https://ruor.uottawa.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/36b15adc-2a72-4a3f-8368-306d32687689/content)

Upon completion, a user may also inference using an already trained model!
