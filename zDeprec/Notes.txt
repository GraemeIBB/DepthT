Two methods of utilizing yolo for depth and RGBD

- two cnns; one for rgb one for depth
    - may be easier to implement; more computationally expensive


Tangent:
Instead of training with depth data, once possible object is found (like gate), check depth value for an array of pixels
on each side of the gate such that the relative angle of the gate can be found


Aim to capture at least rgb image stream over network from robot, can then apply yolo on that
provide a downloadable package containing everything robot needs to run yolo locally
