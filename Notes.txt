Two methods of utilizing yolo for depth and RGBD

- two cnns; one for rgb one for depth
    - may be easier to implement; more computationally expensive

- Change number of channels that yolo takes to 4
    - Hard to implement, less expensive
    - 


Tangent:
Instead of training with depth data, once possible object is found (like gate), check depth value for an array of pixels
on each side of the gate such that the relative angle of the gate can be found
